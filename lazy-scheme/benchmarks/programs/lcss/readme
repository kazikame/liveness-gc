---The program file present in this folder has been used to calculate data during garbage collection.
---fsm folder contains the corresponding cache files.
---data folder contains the files with data calculated during garbage collection process.
	---garbage-dump_<name>.txt file has been generated from gc.c file. (see detail_gc function inside it).
	   Its format is: current cells, current memory, copy cells, copy memory, garbage cells, garbage memory, heap slots
	   Each line corresponds to a instance of GC durin program execution.
	---csv file adds one more filed to each line of garbage-dump file, i.e. , time taken in that particular instance of 
	   GC. Second last line it has been generated from gc.c which ha been calculated at the end of program.
	---Last line has starting tag final in it and its format is : no. of gc invocations , total gc time, program 		   execution time (excluding GC).
	For more details, see function 'generateData' in file collector_gc.py. 

Heap Memory for no Gc (Total Heap Memory required by the program): 12495360 Bytes

Heap Memory set for Garbage Collection Test: 3145728 Bytes.
